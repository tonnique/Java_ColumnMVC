# Java_ColumnsMVC
Columns is a tetris like game writting in Java using MVC pattern.

The aim in the game is to place falling blocks (you can switch the colors in falling blocks) 
in order to have 3 or more matched colors into horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions. 
When you have matched colors you recieve scores.

Here you can use
<ul>
<li>left/right arrow keys or A/D keys to move block left or right.</li>
<li>up arrow key or W key in order to switch colors of the block.</li>
<li>down arrow key or Space key or S key in order to drop the block onto the ground.</li>
</ul>
